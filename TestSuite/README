Automated:
    - UnitTests can be completed quickly to test basic functionality of units are working
    - IntegrationTests can be completed quickly to test multiple component interaction
    - FunctionalTests will test functional requirements, but may take longer to complete
    
Non-Automated:
    - ManualTests will allow manual testing of the functional requirements of the project, but either requires manual
        intervention as part of the test, or continues forever thus requiring manual termination after the test has
        been observed to be satisfactory
        
Note: The Unit Tests may test multiple classes interacting but that are part of the same functionality, 
      whereas Integration Tests test different components of the system working together. Functional Tests test parts of 
      the system as a whole using its actual protocol, and automate whether those tests are within acceptable test parameters
