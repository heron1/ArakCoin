Automated:
    - UnitTests and IntegrationTests can be completed quickly to test basic functionality of units are working
    - FunctionalTests will test functional requirements, but may take longer to complete
    
Non-Automated:
    - ManualTests will allow manual testing of the functional requirements of the project, but either requires manual
        intervention as part of the test, or continues forever thus requiring manual termination after the test has
        been observed to be satisfactory
