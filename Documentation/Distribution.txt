Assuming a 10 second average block mine time as per the protocol, then there will be 8640 blocks mined per day on average.
Given INITIALIZED_BLOCK_REWARD = 1000 and INITIALIZED_BLOCK_REWARD_HALVING = 8640, then the coin distribution should be
as follows:

1st day -> 1000 block reward per block
2nd day+ -> 500 block reward per block
4th day+ -> 250 block reward per block
8th day+ -> 125 block reward per block
16th day+ -> 75 block reward per block
32nd day+ -> 37 block reward per block
64th day+ -> 18 block reward per block
128th day+ -> 9 block reward per block
256th day+ -> 4 block reward per block
512th day+ -> 2 block reward per block
1024th day+ -> 1 block reward per block
2048th day+ -> 0 block reward per block (tx fee incentive alone)

Max coin supply: 43717400 (4.3e7) coins based upon a 2048 day distribution
